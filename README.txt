Before using this program, the following classes have database url that WILL NOT WORK:
-createDatabase
-LoadUpScreen
-InventoryScreen
-ItemCreateScreen

Change the dbURL to be your local install folder location and it should operate correctly.

Before running the program, run the createDatabase.main() to generate the necessary tables and sample data
for correct operation.

Happy Questing!
